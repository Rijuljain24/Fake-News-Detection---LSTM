# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to detect **fake news articles** using **Machine Learning (ML) & Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model classifies news as **real or fake** based on textual content.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Preprocessing of textual data (removal of stopwords, lemmatization, etc.)  
✅ ML models like **NLP, LSTM**  
✅ Accuracy and performance evaluation on test data  - 96%
✅ Interactive interface for news verification  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow)  
- **NLP** (NLTK, spaCy)  
- **Machine Learning Models**
